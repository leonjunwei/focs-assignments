## I. Logic

### 1.

The following tables are [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table).

_true_ and _false_ are represented by `T` and `F`. _OR(false, true)_ is commonly written in [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation): `F OR T`.

The second table shows the value of the function _a OR b_, for all possible values _a_ and _b_. For example, _false OR true_ (the second row) has the value _true_ (the final cell of that row).

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ AND _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | F
 T  |  F  | F
 T  |  T  | T

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ OR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | T

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ XOR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | F

a. Construct the truth table for _a XOR (b XOR a)_.
(b XOR a) should be the same as (a XOR b), so

_a_ | _b_ | _b_ XOR _a_ | _a XOR (b XOR a)_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F			F
 F  |  T  | T			T
 T  |  F  | T			F
 T  |  T  | F			T

which seems to be just _b_.

b. Which function corresponds to the English word "or", as used in "You will eat your meat OR you can't have any pudding" (where _a_ = "You will eat your meat" and _b_ = "you can't have any pudding").

_a_ | _b_ | 
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | F

Seems to be the truth table, since false(meat)-false(no pudding) is wrong, false(meat)-(no pudding) is right, meat-false(no pudding) is right and meat-no pudding is wrong.

I think it's XOR, then.

## II. Questions 2â€“6 are the same as in-class activities 2-6

### 2.

Consider the following context-free grammar G:

```
E -> E + E | T         # <- added "| T"
T -> T x T | (E) | a
```

Convert G to a PDA.
 


### 3.

Convert grammar G from (2) to Chomsky Normal Form.

E­0 -> E
E -> EE2
E2 -> PE
P -> +
T -> TT2
T2 -> MT
T -> LT3
T3 -> TR
L -> (
R -> )
T -> a

### 4.

Is the grammar G's language a regular language? If yes, produce a FSA or regular expression for this language. If not, show this. 

Nope. (na)n is in the language, so any FSA with <n states will have a loop when recognizing the first n characters of (na)n. We can then loop that arbitrarily many times to produce (n+xa)n which will still be accepted by the FSA, but is not in the language. By the pumping lemma, G's language is irregular.

### 5.

Theorem 1: The language {a^n b^n c^n} is not a context-free language.

a. Use Theorem 1, together with the languages {a^i b^i c^j} and {a^i b^j c^j}, to show that the set of context-free languages is not closed under intersection.

{a^i b^i c^j} is a CFL with grammar
S -> episilon | Tc
T -> aTb

Similiarly, {a^i b^j c^j} is a CFL with grammar:
S -> episilon | aT
T -> bTc

But their intersection is {a^n b^n c^n}, which is not a CFL according to Theorem 1. Therefore there exists an intersection of two context free languages that is not context-free, and the set is not closed under intersection.

b. Use the pumping lemma for context-free languages [Sipser pp. 125] to prove Theorem 1.

If a language L is context-free, then there exists some integer p ? 1 such that every string s in L that has a length of p or more symbols (i.e. with |s| ? p) can be written as
s = uvwxy
with substrings u, v, w, x and y, such that
1. |vwx| ? p,
2. |vx| ? 1, and
3. uvnwxny is in L for all n ? 0.

apbpcp should be in the language, and since |vwx| ? p, we can only choose 2 characters at best to be in vwx (vwx can overlap the a-b boundary, the b-c boundary, or it can lie entirely in a, b or c). Either way, when we pump vwx to vnwxn, we expect the result to be in L, but since we can only pump one or two characters, ending up with anbncn is impossible.

### 6.

Consider the context-free grammar G:

```
S -> NP VP
NP -> NP PP
NP -> DET N
VP -> V NP
VP -> VP PP
DET -> a | the
N -> boy | girl | flowers | binoculars
V -> touches | sees
PP -> P NP
P -> in | from | with
```

a. Show that the string "the girl touches the boy with the flower" has two
different leftmost derivations.

Trivially:
(the girl) touches (the boy with the feather)
and (the girl) touches (the boy) (with the feather)


b. Describe in English the two different meanings of this sentence.

Either the girl touches the boy who holds a feather, or the girl uses a feather to touch the boy.

c. Use G to generate another ambiguous sentence.

The girl sees the boy with the binoculars.

d. Modify G so that it generates strings with adjectives: `the girl saw the tall boy`, `the girl touches the boy with a purple flower`.

we change
NP -> DET N
to
NP -> DET ADJ N

You don't need to know this, but here's how the variable names relate to linguistics.

Variable | meaning
---|---
S | sentence
DET | determiner (article)
N | noun
NP | noun phrase
P | preposition
PP | prepositional phrase
V | verb
VP | verb phrase
